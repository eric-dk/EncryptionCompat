# EncryptionCompat

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/eric-dk/EncryptionCompat.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#eric-dk/EncryptionCompat)

Android encryption simplified. Automatic key management, preferring secure hardware. Backwards-compatible across platform versions. Best for obfuscating sensitive on-device data.

**Please carefully consider your threat model**. Encryption alone is not a security solution. Keys, even if hardware-backed, can [be extracted](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html#ExtractionPrevention). Any data that touches a client should be considered compromisable.

Keys are *AES-256*, *CBC*, *PKCS7-padded*, but key management depends on the specified platform version.

* **Jelly Bean and below**: Per-message key is generated from a password stored in [shared preferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) and a random salt. Salt, initialization vector, and ciphertext are then encoded.

* **KitKat through Lollipop**: Per-instance key is wrapped with a global RSA key saved to [the keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html). Keystore may be hardware-backed. Wrapped key, initialization vector, and ciphertext are then encoded.

* **Marshmallow and above**: Global key is managed by the keystore. Keystore may be hardware-backed. Initialization vector and ciphertext are then encoded.

## Usage

#### Initialization
```java
EncryptionCompat encryption = EncryptionCompat.newInstance();
```
For backwards-compatibility below Marshmallow:
```java
EncryptionCompat encryption = EncryptionCompat.newInstance(minSdk, context);
```

#### Data handling
```java
String encoded = encryption.encrypt("foobar");
String decoded = encryption.decrypt(encoded);
```

Encryption and decryption are blocking, and should be executed on non-UI thread(s). Checked exceptions are rethrown as unchecked EncyptionExceptions.

## Gradle

#### Add dependency to build.gradle
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

implementation 'com.github.eric-dk:EncryptionCompat:2.0.1'
```

## FAQ

#### Is there integrity protection?
No. EncryptionCompat provides data confidentiality only. Integrity checks should be implemented downstream.

#### Are random values securely generated?
Generally yes. Salt [randomization](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/SecureRandom.html) may have weak entropy depending [on manufacturer](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html). Initialization vector may be [zero-filled](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31037133) if [the cipher](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher.html) is similarly poorly implemented.

#### Will upgrading OS invalidate data?
No. Decryption should reuse previous keys assuming no loss [due to hardware](https://doridori.github.io/android-security-the-forgetful-keystore/). When crossing implementation boundaries subsequent encryption will generate new, more secure keys.
