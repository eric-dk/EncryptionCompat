# EncryptionCompat

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/com.github.eric-dk/EncryptionCompat.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#com.github.eric-dk/EncryptionCompat)

Android encryption simplified. Automatic key management, preferring secure hardware. Backwards compatible across platform versions. Best for obfuscating sensitive data.

**Carefully consider your threat model**. Encryption alone is not security; keys can be extracted given [enough means](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html#ExtractionPrevention). All data that touches a client should be considered compromisable.

Messages are encrypted with a *AES256/CBC/PKCS7* key, but the key management scheme depends on device support.

* **Least secure (below API 18)**: A per-message key is created from a random salt and a global password - stored in [shared preferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences). The initialization vector, ciphertext, and salt are then encoded.

* **More secure (API 18-22)**: A per-instance key is wrapped with a global asymmetric key - saved in the [Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html). The initialization vector, ciphertext, and wrapped key are then encoded.

* **Most secure (API 23+)**: A global key is managed by the Android Keystore, which may be bound to a trusted execution environment. The initialization vector and ciphertext are then encoded.

* **Most secure (API 28+)**: Same as above, but the key is stored in a [hardware security module](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore#HardwareSecurityModule); only available on a [few devices](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationSamples). The initialization vector and ciphertext are then encoded.

Due to manufacturer fragmentation, EncryptionCompat will attempt the highest possible scheme then fall through until reaching the specified minimum platform.

## Usage

#### Initialization

EncryptionCompat requires `Context` and a minimum platform, which should be equal to `minSdkVersion`. However, going lower increases compatibility with troublesome devices (see sample).

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val encryption = EncryptionCompat(context, minSdk)
```
**Java**
```java
EncryptionCompat encryption = new EncryptionCompat(context, minSdk);
```

A version with [RxJava 2.x](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) bindings is also available.

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val encryption = RxEncryptionCompat(context, minSdk)
```
**Java**
```java
RxEncryptionCompat encryption = new RxEncryptionCompat(context, minSdk);
```

#### Message handling

EncryptionCompat runs on an independent single thread to ensure sequential key access. You can retrieve output by providing a callback, handling the suspending function, or observing the [RxJava Single](http://reactivex.io/documentation/single.html). Please note that 3.x.x is not backwards compatible and cannot read previously encrypted messages.

## Gradle

#### Adding dependency

Add the maven repository to the project `build.gradle`:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to the module `build.gradle`:
```gradle
// If using callbacks or coroutines
implementation 'com.github.eric-dk.EncryptionCompat:core:3.0.0'
// If using RxJava only
implementation 'com.github.eric-dk.EncryptionCompat:rx:3.0.0'
```

## FAQ

#### Is integrity protection provided?
No. EncryptionCompat provides confidentiality only. Performing integrity checks downstream is recommended.

#### Are random values securely generated?
Probably. Randomization may have weak entropy depending on [manufacturer](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html). The initialization vector may also be [zero-filled](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31037133).

#### Will upgrading Android invalidate data?
No. Decryption should reuse previous keys [assuming no loss](https://doridori.github.io/android-security-the-forgetful-keystore/). Subsequent messages will be encrypted with new, more secure keys.
